                            <h3>Women asked to avoid burqas, kids skip playtime: <br>Sri Lankan Muslims fear for safety</h3>
                            <p>There already have been a few incidents that have been reported of Muslims being targeted by mobs. That is the fear most Muslims in Sri Lanka are living with after one of the worst terrorist attack that the country witnessed on Easter Sunday.

Razia has not sent her children out to play out of fear that they might fall victim to people who are seeing all Muslims through the prism of violent extremism. Her husband, an upstanding citizen, has been taken into custody for questioning. Their fault, they are the immediate neighbours of the two main bombers, the Ibrahim brothers.

Men from that entire neighbourhood of Dematagoda have been picked up for questioning and those who haven't have left the colony to stay with their relatives for fear of being taken in.

The fear has spread far and wide. In a country that didn't have a history of religious violence but more so ethnic war, this new development has changed the dynamics of the island nation.

Sleepless nights and fear to venture out. Will they face retribution for the deeds of these terrorists who waged war and have managed to create strife between two communities that have not known hatred at all?

An angry Christian father, Endeke Fernandes, who has lost his daughter, spoke in a rage and referred to the other community as "those Muslims". Once they lived in peace, today they look at every person in a Burqa or a man sporting a beard, with suspicion.</p>

                            <p>Sri Lanka has been on high alert since the attacks on Easter Sunday, with nearly 10,000 soldiers deployed across the island to carry out searches and hunt down members of two local Islamist groups believed to have carried out the attack. Churches across Sri Lanka suspended Sunday mass as security concerns remained high a week after suicide bombers killed over 250 in churches and hotels across the island nation.

Sri Lanka has been on high alert since the attacks on Easter Sunday, with nearly 10,000 soldiers deployed across the island to carry out searches and hunt down members of two local Islamist groups believed to have carried out the attack.

Authorities have detained over 100 people since the bombings in three churches and four hotels, most of which were in the capital Colombo.

The Archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, held a solemn special mass from a church adjacent to his house that was broadcast live across local television and radio."We cannot kill someone in the name of god...It is a great tragedy that happened," the archbishop said in his sermon, attended by President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

"We extend our hand of friendship and fraternity to all our brothers and sisters of whatever class, society or religion that differentiates us."After the sermon, the archbishop and the political leaders lit candles to commemorate the victims of the suicide bombings.

Sri Lanka's 22 million people include minority Christians, Muslims and Hindus. Until now, Christians had largely managed to avoid the worst of the island's conflict and communal tensions.Muslims had been urged to pray at home on Friday after the State Intelligence Services warned of possible car bomb attacks, amid fears of retaliatory violence. </p>

                            <p>Ten days after Indonesia held the world’s biggest single-day elections, more than 270 election staff have died, mostly of fatigue-related illneses caused by long hours of work counting millions of ballot papers by hand, an official said on Sunday.en days after Indonesia held the world’s biggest single-day elections, more than 270 election staff have died, mostly of fatigue-related illneses caused by long hours of work counting millions of ballot papers by hand, an official said on Sunday.

The April 17 elections were the first time the country of 260 million people combined the presidential vote with national and regional parliamentary ones, with an aim to cut costs.

Voting was largely peaceful and was estimated to have drawn 80 percent of the total 193 million voters, who each had to punch up to five ballot papers in over 800,000 polling stations.

But conducting the eight-hour vote in a country that stretches more than 5,000 km (3,000 miles) from its western to eastern tips proven to be both a Herculean logistical feat and deadly for officials, who had to count ballot papers by hand.

As of Saturday night, 272 election officials had died, mostly from overwork-related illnesses, while 1,878 others had fallen ill, said Arief Priyo Susanto, spokesman of the General Elections Commission (KPU).

The Health Ministry issued a circular letter on April 23 urging health facilities to give utmost care for sick election staff, while the Finance Ministry is working on compensation for families of the deceased, Susanto added.

The KPU has come under fire due to the rising death toll.

The KPU is not prudent in managing the workload of staff, said Ahmad Muzani, deputy chairman of the campaign of opposition presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto, reported by news website Kumparan.com.

                            <p>Indian-American Hirsh Singh has announced that he will seek the Republican nomination for US Senate in 2020 against Democratic New Jersey Senator Cory Booker. The Republican has already filed documents forming his campaign committee with the Federal Election Commission. Indian-American Hirsh Singh has announced that he will seek the Republican nomination for US Senate in 2020 against Democratic New Jersey Senator Cory Booker.

Hirsh Singh, a director for Hi-Tech Systems in New Jersey, on Thursday said in a Facebook post, "Help me fix Jersey. Spread the news, we're here to win. Today, I launch my campaign for US Senate. For the People of New Jersey. Let's remove Cory Booker."The Republican has already filed documents forming his campaign committee with the Federal Election Commission, The American Bazaar reported.

This is not Hirsh Singh's first innings in politics; in fact, this is his third bid for the public office.

Last year, he lost in the Republican primaries to Seth Grossman when, he ran for the second Congressional District seat. Before that, in 2017, Singh ran in the Republican primary for the governor.

Hirsh Singh is an engineer by profession and is from Atlantic City. According to The Shore News Network, Hirsh Singh has picked up the endorsement of Bill Palatucci, a member of the Republican National Committee, from New Jersey.

Hirsh Singh is the first Republican to announce challenge to Booker, who is also running for President.

On his newly launched website, Singh announced, "We, the people of New Jersey, are suffering from political extremism and out-of-control egos. Our representatives have forgotten who they serve. Our economic engine is choking and our infrastructure is crumbling. Together, we will rebuild the state."

</h3>
                            <p>New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has got income tax refunds at least five times in the last 18 years, while Congress chief Rahul Gandhi has received six refunds in the same period.

Besides, the refunds for assessment years 2015-2016 and 2012-2013 were "adjusted against outstanding demand" in case of Modi, while it was the case for Gandhi in assessment year 2011-2012.
                            
                            This is based on the online 'refund status' service provided by the Tax Information Network of the Income Tax Department, managed by NSDL e-Governance Infrastructure Limited.

Rahul Gandhi's mother and senior Congress leader Sonia Gandhi has also got at least five refunds since the assessment year 2001-2002, but there is no adjustment against any outstanding demand for her in this time period.

On the other hand, BJP chief Amit Shah's income tax refund was "adjusted against outstanding demand" for the assessment year 2015-2016. The TIN-NSDL records do not show any other refund for him in the last 18 years.This is based on the online 'refund status' service provided by the Tax Information Network of the Income Tax Department, managed by NSDL e-Governance Infrastructure Limited.

                            <p>Election 2019 LIVE: Gautam Gambhir, the BJP candidate from east Delhi, has hit back at his opponent and AAP leader Atishi for alleging that he is a registered voter from two constituencies, saying that one only makes such allegations when no work has been done. 

"When you don't have a vision and have done nothing in the last 4.5 years, you make such allegations, EC will decide this. When you have a vision you don't do such negative politics," the cricketer-turned-politician said. Atishi had on Saturday said she had filed a criminal complaint against Gambhir, claiming that he is registered as a voter in two constituencies, and demanded that his candidature be cancelled. A day after Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his statements in which he claimed to belong to the "most-backward caste" community, Congress leader P Chidambaram slammed him in a series of tweets. 

The Congress leader said Modi had campaigned in 2014 wearing his caste on his sleeve, but now claims to be above it. “In 2014 and thereafter, he said repeatedly that he is proud that the people elected a chaiwala as PM. Now he says, he never mentioned his origins as a chaiwala! What does the PM take us for? A bunch of idiots who have large memory losses?” he asked.

                            <h3>In Amethi to Woo the Voters, Rahul Gandhi Pauses Rally Speech For Azaan</h3>
                            <p>Amethi: Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Saturday paused his speech during an election rally in Amethi when the Azaan, the Islamic call for prayer, sounded from a nearby mosque. 

Gandhi, who is holding rallies in Congress bastion seats Raebareili and Amethi, stayed silent till the prayer ended and then resumed his speech.In March last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also paused his victory speech to party workers midway on hearing the Azaan from a mosque near the party’s new headquarters in New Delhi. He stayed silent for two minutes and the party workers also remained still till the time the call for prayer continued. As soon as it got over, PM Modi resumed his speech with chants of ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’ and the party workers joined him with great fervour.

During the campaign for Gujarat elections in November 2017, too, the PM, speaking at a rally in Navsari, had stopped briefly to let Azaan finish. In 2016, PM Modi stopped his speech for over five minutes during an election rally in West Bengal’s Kharagpur when he heard the sound of Azaan.

In 2014, BJP president Amit Shah had done the same. Addressing a rally in Kolkata, Shah paused when the muezzin's call for prayers was sounded from a mosque close by and said he didn't want to give West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee an excuse to speak against him. </p>

                            <p>Lionel Messi clinched an eighth La Liga title for Barcelona in 11 seasons on Saturday as he scored the only goal in a 1-0 win at home to Levante.

The Argentine star struck his league-leading 34th goal of the campaign after coming off the bench for the second half to help Barca wrap up the title with three games remaining.

Barca hold a nine-point lead over second-placed Atletico Madrid, but the Catalans cannot be overtaken thanks to their superior head-to-head record.

It is Barca’s 26th league title and nudges them closer to Real Madrid’s record of 33 in Spain.“To win the title with a distance and gap is difficult with the rivals we have. We’ve done it two years in a row,” Barca coach Ernesto Valverde told Movistar.

“We’re happy and to see people enjoying it makes us proud. But we still have challenges ahead.” Valverde initially left Messi on the bench with Wednesday’s Champions League semi-final first leg against Liverpool in mind, but he replaced Philippe Coutinho at the break at the Camp Nou.

Coutinho and Luis Suarez pressed Levante goalkeeper Aitor Fernandez into action early on, the Brazilian coming closest to breaking the deadlock when his free-kick rattled the crossbar shortly before half-time.

He was sacrificed for Messi though, and it proved an inspired decision as the Argentine swept in the winner on 62 minutes following a frantic scramble inside the Levante area.

                            <p>The Indian Premier League (IPL) can bring out the competitive side of some cricketers but on Sunday, it was not the case as Indian cricket team skipper Virat Kohli shared a light moment with teammate Rishabh Pant during the match between Royal Challengers Bangalore and Delhi Capitals.

In the fourth over, Kohli edged a delivery from Ishant Sharma and Pant took a sharp catch behind the wicket. Although the fielders were convinced that the catch was clean, Kohli remained adamant that it took a bounce ahead of the wicket-keeper and the umpires went for a review.

The replay showed that the ball did bounce before Pant collected it and the decision went in Kohli’s favour. Ishant did not look happy with the decision but Kohli and Pant shared a laugh afterwards and even shared a fist bump.

Earlier, Delhi Capitals rode on half-centuries by opener Shikhar Dhawan and skipper Shreyas Iyer to post a challenging 187/5 in their 20 overs against Royal Challengers Bangalore.The hosts finished on a high, amassing 60 runs in the last five overs. While Dhawan and Iyer put on 68 runs for the second wicket, Sherfane Rutherford (28*) and Axar Patel (16*) finished well as the RCB bowlers failed to drive home the initiative even after sending back the established batsmen in the middle order cheaply.<br><br><br>Thank You</p>

                            <h3>Thank you Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni’: Aaron Finch lauds duo for incredible gesture</h3>
                            <p>Australia ODI skipper Aaron Finch heaped praise on India captain Virat Kohli and wicket-keeper-batsman Mahendra Singh Dhoni for their wonderful gesture on Sunday.

Finch revealed he was gifted jerseys by Kohli and Dhoni during the series between India and Australia in March earlier this year. Finch’s troops had beaten the ‘Men in Blue in both T20I and ODI series at home before the start of the Indian Premier League (IPL).

The Australian skipper’s Instagram post read: “Thank you @virat.kohli & @mahi7781. Very lucky to have been given a shirt by both guys during the last series we played against India. Whilst we battle it out hard for our countries on the field, the respect I have for 2 of the games all time greats is huge! It’s important to take some time to be grateful and appreciate the opportunities we have been given!”

The two teams will now cross paths once again at the ICC World Cup 2019, which starts May 30 in UK. India play their second match of the tournament against Australia after their opening encounter against South Africa.

Both India and Australia are touted as favourites to lift the crown at the iconic Lord’s on July 14. While India will pin their hopes on talismanic skipper Virat Kohli, Australia have been boosted by the return of Steve Smith and David Warner.
