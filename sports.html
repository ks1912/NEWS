                            <h3>India top medal tally at Beijing Shooting World Cup</h3>
                            <p>India drew blank on the final day but still topped the chart for the second consecutive ISSF World Cup, third time in two years, by bagging three gold and a silver at the Beijing edition of the Rifle/Pistol event here.

India topped the medals tally ahead of hosts China (2 gold, 2 silver, 1 bronze), who won five medals in total. In the last edition in New Delhi, India had jointly topped the standings with Hungary.

For India, while Anjum Moudgil and young Divyansh Singh Panwar started the medal hunt with a gold in the 10m Air Rifle Mixed Team competition, the teenaged pair of Manu Bhaker and Saurabh Chaudhary backed them up with another yellow metal in the 10m Air Pistol Mixed Team Pistol event.

Divyansh then won India’s first individual medal by clinching a silver in the men’s 10m Air Rifle. On Saturday, Abhishek Verma won India’s third gold in men’s 10m Air Pistol event.

The concluding day of the ISSF World Cup Rifle/Pistol Beijing 2019 edition however, belonged to two women legends of the sport, two-time former Olympic champion Maria Grozdeva of Bulgaria and Croatian Rifle legend Snjezana Pejcic, who won the two scheduled finals of the day, the 25m Pistol and the 50m Rifle 3 Positions (3P).

In the first final on Sunday, the 46-year old Maria, champion in the 25m Pistol at the Sydney 2000 and Beijing 2004 Olympics, shot 36 in the final to beat a couple of young rising stars. <br> Thankyou</p>

                            <h3>Messi fires Barcelona to eighth La Liga title in 11 years</h3>
                            <p>Lionel Messi clinched an eighth La Liga title for Barcelona in 11 seasons on Saturday as he scored the only goal in a 1-0 win at home to Levante.

The Argentine star struck his league-leading 34th goal of the campaign after coming off the bench for the second half to help Barca wrap up the title with three games remaining.

Barca hold a nine-point lead over second-placed Atletico Madrid, but the Catalans cannot be overtaken thanks to their superior head-to-head record.

It is Barca’s 26th league title and nudges them closer to Real Madrid’s record of 33 in Spain.“To win the title with a distance and gap is difficult with the rivals we have. We’ve done it two years in a row,” Barca coach Ernesto Valverde told Movistar.

“We’re happy and to see people enjoying it makes us proud. But we still have challenges ahead.” Valverde initially left Messi on the bench with Wednesday’s Champions League semi-final first leg against Liverpool in mind, but he replaced Philippe Coutinho at the break at the Camp Nou.

Coutinho and Luis Suarez pressed Levante goalkeeper Aitor Fernandez into action early on, the Brazilian coming closest to breaking the deadlock when his free-kick rattled the crossbar shortly before half-time.

He was sacrificed for Messi though, and it proved an inspired decision as the Argentine swept in the winner on 62 minutes following a frantic scramble inside the Levante area.

                            <p>The Indian Premier League (IPL) can bring out the competitive side of some cricketers but on Sunday, it was not the case as Indian cricket team skipper Virat Kohli shared a light moment with teammate Rishabh Pant during the match between Royal Challengers Bangalore and Delhi Capitals.

In the fourth over, Kohli edged a delivery from Ishant Sharma and Pant took a sharp catch behind the wicket. Although the fielders were convinced that the catch was clean, Kohli remained adamant that it took a bounce ahead of the wicket-keeper and the umpires went for a review.

The replay showed that the ball did bounce before Pant collected it and the decision went in Kohli’s favour. Ishant did not look happy with the decision but Kohli and Pant shared a laugh afterwards and even shared a fist bump.

Earlier, Delhi Capitals rode on half-centuries by opener Shikhar Dhawan and skipper Shreyas Iyer to post a challenging 187/5 in their 20 overs against Royal Challengers Bangalore.The hosts finished on a high, amassing 60 runs in the last five overs. While Dhawan and Iyer put on 68 runs for the second wicket, Sherfane Rutherford (28*) and Axar Patel (16*) finished well as the RCB bowlers failed to drive home the initiative even after sending back the established batsmen in the middle order cheaply.<br><br><br>Thank You</p>

                            <h3>Thank you Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni | aaron Finch lauds duo for incredible gesture</h3>
                            <p>Australia ODI skipper Aaron Finch heaped praise on India captain Virat Kohli and wicket-keeper-batsman Mahendra Singh Dhoni for their wonderful gesture on Sunday.

Finch revealed he was gifted jerseys by Kohli and Dhoni during the series between India and Australia in March earlier this year. Finch’s troops had beaten the ‘Men in Blue in both T20I and ODI series at home before the start of the Indian Premier League (IPL).

The Australian skipper’s Instagram post read: “Thank you @virat.kohli & @mahi7781. Very lucky to have been given a shirt by both guys during the last series we played against India. Whilst we battle it out hard for our countries on the field, the respect I have for 2 of the games all time greats is huge! It’s important to take some time to be grateful and appreciate the opportunities we have been given!”

The two teams will now cross paths once again at the ICC World Cup 2019, which starts May 30 in UK. India play their second match of the tournament against Australia after their opening encounter against South Africa.

Both India and Australia are touted as favourites to lift the crown at the iconic Lord’s on July 14. While India will pin their hopes on talismanic skipper Virat Kohli, Australia have been boosted by the return of Steve Smith and David Warner.
